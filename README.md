# ChatGPT Whatsapp Integration

In order to connect ChatGPT to WhatsApp, you will need to use the WhatsApp Business API. This API allows you to interact with WhatsApp users and send them messages, including automated messages from ChatGPT.

Here is an example of how to connect ChatGPT to WhatsApp using the WhatsApp Business API:

First, you will need to register for the WhatsApp Business API. You can do this by visiting the WhatsApp Business API website and filling out the registration form.

Once you have registered, you will need to create a new "session" with the WhatsApp Business API. This can be done by sending a POST request to the API's session endpoint, including your API key and other necessary information.

Once you have created a session, you can send messages to WhatsApp users using the API's "send message" endpoint. To do this, you will need to include the recipient's phone number, the message text, and other information in the request.

To use ChatGPT to generate automated messages, you can use the OpenAI API to generate text, and then send it as a message to the WhatsApp user.

To handle incoming messages, you can use the WhatsApp Business API's "message received" webhook to receive notifications when a user sends a message to your WhatsApp number.

Once you receive the incoming message, you can use ChatGPT to generate a response and send it back to the user via the WhatsApp Business API.

Note: To use WhatsApp Business API, you need a WhatsApp business account, which you can get by applying for it on their website.
